## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp.git
cd chrome-devtools-mcp
npm ci
npm run build
```

### Testing with @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/src/index.js
```

### Testing with an MCP client

Add the MCP server to your client's config.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path-to/build/src/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using with VS Code SSH

When running the `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` it spawns 2 services - one on port `6274` and one on `6277`.
Usually VS Code automatically detects and forwards `6274` but fails to detect `6277` so you need to manually forward it.

### Debugging

To write debug logs to `log.txt` in the working directory, run with the following commands:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/src/index.js --log-file=/your/desired/path/log.txt
```

You can use the `DEBUG` environment variable as usual to control categories that are logged.

### Updating documentation

When adding a new tool or updating a tool name or description, make sure to run `npm run docs` to generate the tool reference documentation.
