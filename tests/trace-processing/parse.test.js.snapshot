Available insights:
  - insight name: LCPBreakdown
    description: Each [subpart has specific improvement strategies](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp#lcp-breakdown). Ideally, most of the LCP time should be spent on loading the resources, not within delays.
    relevant trace bounds: {min: 122410996889, max: 122411126100}
    example question: Help me optimize my LCP score
    example question: Which LCP phase was most problematic?
    example question: What can I do to reduce the LCP time for this page load?
  - insight name: LCPDiscovery
    description: Optimize LCP by making the LCP image [discoverable](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp#1_eliminate_resource_load_delay) from the HTML immediately, and [avoiding lazy-loading](https://web.dev/articles/lcp-lazy-loading)
    relevant trace bounds: {min: 122411004828, max: 122411055039}
    example question: Suggest fixes to reduce my LCP
    example question: What can I do to reduce my LCP discovery time?
    example question: Why is LCP discovery time important?
  - insight name: RenderBlocking
    description: Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. [Deferring or inlining](https://web.dev/learn/performance/understanding-the-critical-path#render-blocking_resources) can move these network requests out of the critical path.
    relevant trace bounds: {min: 122411037528, max: 122411053852}
    example question: Show me the most impactful render blocking requests that I should focus on
    example question: How can I reduce the number of render blocking requests?
  - insight name: DocumentLatency
    description: Your first network request is the most important.  Reduce its latency by avoiding redirects, ensuring a fast server response, and enabling text compression.
    relevant trace bounds: {min: 122410998910, max: 122411043781}
    estimated metric savings: FCP 0 ms, LCP 0 ms
    estimated wasted bytes: 77.1 kB
    example question: How do I decrease the initial loading time of my page?
    example question: Did anything slow down the request for this document?
  - insight name: ThirdParties
    description: 3rd party code can significantly impact load performance. [Reduce and defer loading of 3rd party code](https://web.dev/articles/optimizing-content-efficiency-loading-third-party-javascript/) to prioritize your page's content.
    relevant trace bounds: {min: 122411037881, max: 122416229595}
    example question: Which third parties are having the largest impact on my page performance?
